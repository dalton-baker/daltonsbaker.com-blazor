        <h5>
            I created this website to display market data in a clean, easy to read ui. I made this for coin and pawn shops
            initially, but moved to making a nice mobile interface as well. The server scrapes the web and updates the prices in 5 minute intervals.
        </h5>
        <h5>Currently this site is written in php, but I am in the process of rewriting it in Blazor.</h5>
