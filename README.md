This is a website I made to show off my portfolio. I originally made it in php and html, however I like .NET framework a lot more. So, I decided to try and publish a static Blazor version of this website to the linux server where I am hosting it. It worked! I was even able to set up a CI/CD pipeline using github actions.

This website still serves as my portfolio, but I am also using it as a test site for technologies before I deploy them in other websites.
